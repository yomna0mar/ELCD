            <h3>An Early Lung Cancer Detection System</h3>
            <h4>Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, where its detection occurs in the final stages and remission is no longer an option.</h4>
            <p>In order to decrease preventable cases of death and improve the overall health system, a more versatile and agile system has to be adopted. Through the use of several data mining algorithms, ELCD uses data from real lung cancer patients in the UAE in order to make accurate conclusions about prospective patients. ELCD is to be used to supplement and aid in the decision making of a professional. Thus, the patients’ physicians are to input symptoms and medical test results into the system to assess the probability of cancer risk. Even though the final decision lies with the patient’s oncologist, ELCD hopes to perform a more targeted analysis by providing using the patient's medical and family history and any other ailments that may have an impact on the final diagnosis, making the app specifically tailored to every patient.</p>
            <p>ELCD is a medical expert system that monitors its user’s symptoms in hopes of detecting lung cancer in its earliest stages. The user inputs his/her vital health signs and symptoms into the system when applicable with the help of his/her physician. Such readings are then deciphered by the app’s AI against the user’s average and normal health status. According to changes in the user’s vital signs that deem out of range, the AI would be able to detect changes in the body’s immunity, and hence warning its user of the probable onset of the fatal lung cancer. Moreover, the user must also keep track of other vital signs, such as imaging tests, cancer marker ranges, biopsies, and lung cancer symptoms, including, but not limited to, worsening chest pains and hoarseness. More importantly, the user must be aware that inputting these kinds of symptoms and tests will aid the data mining algorithms in reaching a more accurate and speedy diagnosis. Consequently, this will help in the early detection of lung cancer, increasing the chances of remission. Nonetheless, it ought to be considered that the app’s conclusions are never final, and user will always be forewarned to re-consult with their primary physician.</p>
