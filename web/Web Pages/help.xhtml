            <h3>Using the System</h3>
            <p>Users cannot create accounts on their own. This is done to ensure that oncologists with the system are verified by their medical institutions and that patients are actual cancer patients. This frees up the system from fake accounts, allowing geniune users to utilize the system without interruption.</p>
            <h3>Creating an Account</h3>
            <p>Once your medical institution has contacted us for a subscription, you, as a physician, may forward any questions or concerns to your system admin about obtaining an account. However, as a patient, you must request access to the system by talking to your physician, which in turn will talk to the admin about granting you access to ELCD.</p>
            <h3>Requesting a Subscription</h3>
            <p>If you are an institution that is interested in integrating ELCD to your patient care facilities, please visit our <a href="contact.xhtml">Contact</a> page. If you are an individual that wishes to use ELCD, forward your interest to your institution in order for them contact us.</p>
            <h3>Account Maintenance</h3>
            <p>Once subscribed to our system, all account maintenace lies within the hands of your intitution's admin.</p>
            <h3>Terminating your Subscription</h3>
            <p>Just like with requesting a subscription, please visit our <a href="contact.xhtml">Contact</a> page.</p>
            <h3>System Trials</h3>
            <p>You can visit our <a href="contact.xhtml">Contact</a> page to request a free trial to see whether or not ELCD is for you.</p>
